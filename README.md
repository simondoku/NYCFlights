# Big Data Analysis with Dask

This project uses Dask, a flexible library for parallel computing in Python, to perform big data analysis on flight data.

## Project Description

The project involves analyzing a dataset of flights from NYC in between 1990-1999. The analysis includes:

1. Calculating departure delays from JFK Airport.
2. Identifying the airline with the least average departure delay from JFK.
3. Grouping by carrier and calculating mean and standard deviation of departure delay.

## Dependencies

- Python
- Dask
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage

To run the project, simply execute the `bigData.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment.

## Data

The data used in this project is stored in the `data/nycflights directory. The dataset includes information about flights such as the origin, destination, departure delay, and more.
